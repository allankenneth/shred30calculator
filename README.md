# Shred :30 Calculator
Footbag Freestyle Shred :30 Event Score Calculator. Takes groups of ADD values using 0 to denote
non-unique moves, and calculates a score based on the ADDs + (ADDs/Contacts) * uniques forumla as
outlined in http://www.footbag.org/rules/chapter/500#506

Enter each contact's ADD value; if the move is not unique, append a 0 after (e.g ripwalk > ripwalk > ripwalk > torque = 44404); drops are '1' (counted as zero-ADD contacts).
